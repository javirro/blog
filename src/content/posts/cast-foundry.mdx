# Foundry tools: Cast

<br />
Foundry is the most relevant and used frameworks nowadays to work with smart contracts
in Solidity. Foundry provides a set of tools to facilitate the development, testing,
and deployment of smart contracts. One of these tools is <b>Cast</b>.

Cast is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with Ethereum nodes and
smart contracts. It provides a variety of commands to perform different tasks,
such as sending transactions, querying contract state, making data conversions,
and more. In this post, we will explore some examples of how to use Cast in
real-world scenarios.

## Cast examples

<br />
In this section, we will see some practical examples of how to use Cast for
different purposes, such as number conversion, reading smart contract values and write smart contract values.

<br /><br />

### Number decimal - hexadecimal conversion

<br />
One of the simplest use cases of Cast is to convert numbers between decimal and hexadecimal
formats. Used especially when dealing with smart contract data.

<ConsoleCommandBlock>
  cast to-dec 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002a
</ConsoleCommandBlock>

<ConsoleCommandBlock>cast to-hex 50</ConsoleCommandBlock>

Those are just two simple examples, but Cast supports many other conversions, such as to-bool, to-address, to-bytes32, etc.

### Call smart contracts to read values
<br />
One of the most common use cases of Cast is to call smart contract functions to read data from the blockchain. It permits easyly
querying contract state without needing to write any code.

The aspects that must be considered are:
<ul>
<li> <b>The contract address: </b> The address of the smart contract you want to interact with. </li>
<li> <b>The function signature: </b> The signature of the function you want to call. </li>
<li> <b>The network RPC URL: </b> The URL of the Ethereum node you want to connect to. You can include directly in the cast service, you can read from .env file or
you can configure it in the foundry.toml file. </li>
</ul>
<ConsoleCommandBlock>
  cast call [contract_address] "number()" --rpc-url [network_rpc_url]
</ConsoleCommandBlock>

In this second example, we are calling the allowance function of an ERC20 token contract to check the allowance
that an address has given to another address. The main differece with the previous example is that this function
requires two parameters: the owner address and the spender address. Furthermore, in this case we are passing the response type (uint256).
 
<ConsoleCommandBlock>
cast call [contract_address] "allowance(address, address)(uint256)" [param1] [param2] --rpc-url [network_rpc_url]
</ConsoleCommandBlock>

### Write smart contracts to update values
<br />
Another important use case of Cast is to send transactions to smart contracts to update their state. This allows you to interact with contracts and modify their data.

When sending transactions, you need to consider:
<ul>
<li> <b>The private key: </b> The private key of the account you want to use to sign the transaction. </li>
<li> <b>The contract address: </b> The address of the smart contract you want to interact with. </li>
<li> <b>The function signature: </b> The signature of the function you want to call. </li>
<li> <b>The network RPC URL: </b> The URL of the Ethereum node you want to connect to. You can include directly in the cast service, you can read from .env file or
you can configure it in the foundry.toml file. </li>
</ul>

In this example, we are calling the mint function of an ERC20 token contract to mint new tokens to a specific address. The function requires two parameters: the recipient address and the amount of tokens to mint.
<ConsoleCommandBlock>
  cast send --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY [contract_address] "mint(address,uint256)" [param1] [param2] --rpc-url $RPC_URL
</ConsoleCommandBlock>

In this second example, we are using the cast parse-units command to convert a human-readable token amount (5 tokens) into its corresponding smallest unit (wei for Ether or the token's smallest denomination). This is particularly useful when dealing with ERC20 tokens that have decimals.
<ConsoleCommandBlock>
  cast send --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY [contract_address] "mint(address,uint256)" [param1] $(cast parse-units 5) --rpc-url $RPC_URL
</ConsoleCommandBlock>
