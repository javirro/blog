# Foundry tools: Cast

<br />
Foundry is the most relevant and used frameworks nowadays to work with smart contracts
in Solidity. Foundry provides a set of tools to facilitate the development, testing,
and deployment of smart contracts. One of these tools is <b>Cast</b>.
<br />
Cast is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with Ethereum nodes and
smart contracts. It provides a variety of commands to perform different tasks,
such as sending transactions, querying contract state, making data conversions,
and more. In this post, we will explore some examples of how to use Cast in
real-world scenarios.

## Cast examples

<br />

### Number decimal - hexadecimal conversion

<ConsoleCommandBlock>
cast to-dec 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002a
</ConsoleCommandBlock>

<ConsoleCommandBlock>
cast to-hex 50
</ConsoleCommandBlock>

### Call to smart contract to read some value

<ConsoleCommandBlock>
cast call [contract_address] "number()" --rpc-url [network_rpc_url]
</ConsoleCommandBlock>

<ConsoleCommandBlock>
cast call [contract_address] "allowance(address, address)(uint256)" [param1] [param2] --rpc-url [network_rpc_url]
</ConsoleCommandBlock>

### Write to smart contract to update some value

<ConsoleCommandBlock>
cast send --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY [contract_address] "mint(address, uint256)" [param1] [param2] --rpc-url $RPC_URL
</ConsoleCommandBlock>

<ConsoleCommandBlock>
cast send --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY [contract_address] "mint(address, uint256)" [param1] $(cast parse-units 5) --rpc-url $RPC_URL
</ConsoleCommandBlock>

## Código Solidity

<SolidityBlock title="Contrato Hola Mundo">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HolaMundo {
string public mensaje = "Hola Mundo";

    function actualizar(string memory _nuevoMensaje) public {
        mensaje = _nuevoMensaje;
    }

}
`}

</SolidityBlock>
