# Foundry tools: Anvil
<br />
Foundry is a key tool to work with smart contracts in Solidity and blockchain networks. Foundry provides a set of tools to facilitate the development, testing,
and deployment of smart contracts. One of these tools is <b>Anvil</b>.

Anvil is a local Ethereum node that runs on your machine. It is designed to be fast and lightweight. It allows developers to test and debug their smart contracts
locally without needing to connect to a remote Ethereum network. Anvil provides a set of features that make it easy to work with smart contracts, such as instant mining,
automatic account creation, and support for multiple networks.
In this post, we will explore some examples of how to use Anvil in real-world scenarios.

## Anvil examples

<br />
In this section, we will see some practical examples of how to use Anvil in different scenarios.

<br /><br />

### Basic initialization

<br />
The simpliest scenario is to run Anvil with the default configuration. This will start a local Ethereum node on your machine with default settings.
You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
<ConsoleCommandBlock>
anvil
</ConsoleCommandBlock>

This command will create a local Ethereum node that listens on <b>http://127.0.0.1:8545</b> and it will create accounts with pre-funded Ether for testing purposes. The chainId will be <b>31337</b> by default.

You can use this network to deploy and test your smart contracts locally, to connect your dApps, or to run scripts that interact with the blockchain.

### Forking real networks
<br />
One of the most common use cases of Anvil is to fork real blockchain networks. This allows you to create a local copy of the state of a real network, such as Mainnet, Goerli, or Sepolia.

In the following example, we will fork the Ethereum Mainnet using an RPC URL from a public provider. You can replace the URL with your own provider if you have one.

<ConsoleCommandBlock>
  anvil --fork-url https://ethereum.reth.rs/rpc
</ConsoleCommandBlock>

This strategy is very useful for testing smart contracts in a realistic environment, as you can interact with real contracts and data without risking real funds.
One of the most common use cases is to test DeFi protocols, as you can simulate trades, liquidity provision, and other interactions with real assets.
In general, you can test any smart contract which has been already deployed on the network you are forking.


Anvil offers additional options for forking, such as specifying a block number to fork from, configuring some network parameters for the new RPC endpoint which you are creating like CORS, request limits, response headers and much more.
All these options are essential to customize the behavior of your local node and to adapt it to your specific needs. You can totally simulate the behavior of a real network with Anvil.
